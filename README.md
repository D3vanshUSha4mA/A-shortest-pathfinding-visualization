RnD Task-ML for Game Characters


OBJECTIVE-To understand the working of classical algorithms and reinforcement learning to drive intelligent behaviour in games.


Manual Grid-based pathfinding with dynamic obstacles-
  Build a pathfinding system from scratch on a grid.
  Supports real time dynamic obstacles.
  It will be implemented using python and pygame.

Reinforcement learning for grid-based navigation-
	Train an RL agent to navigate a grid avoiding static obstacles.
	Focus on learning optimal paths through trial and error using rewards
